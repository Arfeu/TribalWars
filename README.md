Got the idea to make it purchaseable, but dropped it. Here's the code, if you like it, feel free to use it! :)

----------------------------------------

FarmBot for the Game TribalWars (www.tribalwars.net).

Runs via FarmManager. Automatically sends from every given village all light units/or all pages in the FarmManager.

IF MAX loot = sends A, if NOT_MAX = sends B in FarmManager. This is more effective.

I use it myself. Got easily in the top 10-20 of farming in the world. (Even without using it at night).

Should run on all servers (.de, .pl, .net, ..) and most worlds (with FarmManager).

You can run it over night every 15/30/45/60 minutes. It will run automatically. It yet doesn't solves Captchas itself. Feel free to implement it! :)

You can speedup the process of farming, just downgrade the 1000 in 1000 * Random() to e.g: 500 or 250.

Always keep in mind: AutoIT is really great.
