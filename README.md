Got the idea to make it purchaseable, but dropped it. Here's the code, if you like it, feel free to use it! :)

----------------------------------------

FarmBot for the Game TribalWars (www.tribalwars.net).

Runs via FarmManager. Automatically sends from every given village all light units/or all pages in the FarmManager.

IF MAX loot = sends A, if NOT_MAX = sends B in FarmManager. This is more effective.

I use it myself. Got easily in the top 10 of farming in the world. (Even without using it at night).

Should run on all servers (.de, .pl, .net, ..) and most worlds (with FarmManager).

You can run it over night every 15/30/45/60 minutes. It will run automatically. It yet doesn't solves Captchas itself. Feel free to implement it! :)

You can speedup the process of farming, just downgrade the 1000 in 1000 * Random() to e.g: 500 or 250.


PS: If you intend to use it without modifications, be sure to add your name and a CustomCode in my memoization repo in the log file.
You find two examples there. (The Bot fetches the data and checks if your name is given).

Always keep in mind: AutoIT is really great.
